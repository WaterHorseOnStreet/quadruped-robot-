# quadruped-robot-
We consider to start from the stl model of a quadruped dog, create its urdf model to train some motion pattern using reference motion file and reinforment learning. Filnally we want to transfer the trained algorithm to the real physical world. Now we have got the real dog using 3D print machine.
